## API Code of conduct

If possible, always include your `User-Agent` header with a small description of your project and perhaps a way of contacting the author,
or a code link on Github, or anything to describe the project that uses the API.
This extra info makes debugging, error hunting and making statistics a lot easier. ðŸ™‚

## Authorization

In order to access endpoints with required authorization, you must provide your user id/name and your API authorization key.

### Getting an API key

##### Recommended way - Website
1) Head over to the [Get API key](https://supinic.com/user/auth-key) page on the website
2) Log in, if not logged in already
3) Generate your key! Make sure to save both your user ID and the key together

##### Alternative/backup way - Supibot
1) Join any channel on any platform that Supibot is present in
2) PM Supibot with the `authkey generate` command ([code](https://supinic.com/bot/command/153/code))
3) Save the key
4) If you need your user ID, use the `id` command as well
5) If you need to regenerate/remove your API key, use the `authkey invalidate` command

**Disclaimer**: Only use the alternative method in case the recommended one doesn't work, as your key is subject to possible
leaks based on what platform you're in. There's no guarantee that it's going to be safe.

### Using the key

##### Headers
When making a request, in your headers, include the following authorization header structure:

`Authorization: Basic (user-id):(api-key)`

Sample `fetch` request:
```js
await fetch("https://supinic.com/api/auth-test", {
    headers: {
        Authorization: "Basic 12345:abcde"
    }
});
```

##### URL params
When making any request, along with any other params, include these two:
- `auth_user` - your user ID
- `auth_key` - your API key

Sample `fetch` request:
```js
await fetch("https://supinic.com/api/auth-test?auth_user=12345&auth_key=abcde");
```
